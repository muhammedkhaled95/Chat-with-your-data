"""
get_db(): is a function called to get a session to the DB everytime we get a request through our APIs that needs
to talk to the database, so we can call as much as we want, and after that close the session.

While returning the session instance and closing it manually in the caller is possible, using a 
generator function with yield provides automatic resource management, reduces the risk of forgetting to close the session, 
maintains separation of concerns, and integrates well with modern web frameworks. 
This pattern simplifies code management and ensures that resources are handled consistently and correctly.

In web frameworks like FastAPI, the get_db function is called a "dependency" because it provides a necessary resource
(in this case, a database session) to other parts of the application, such as route handlers or other functions.
Dependencies are used to manage and inject required resources or services into various components of an application.

Separation of Concerns: Using dependencies helps separate the concerns of resource management from the business logic of your application .
Route handlers or other functions donâ€™t need to know how to create or manage the database session;
they only need to use it. This makes the code more modular, maintainable, and testable.
